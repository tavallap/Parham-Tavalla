        <p>Clocky is a machine that starts moving on its wheels and make noise to wake up anyone you desire whenever the alarm is set!<br />Here you will see a progress of my designing.</p>

        <h5>Here you can see all components are assembled and I was going to add only 2 wheels, but it would fall down and could not stay staright. So, I added another wheel infront and sticks it with glue. Also, I added glue to hold the battery case on the top becasue of bad designing!</h5>

And finally, the clocky alarm circuit sits on the top and connects to the motors and to 9V battery and 4 AA battery</h5>

        <h5>Here you can see my 3D design for covering the led of the clocky alarm does not fit at all and I should have designed a better one to cover the wholecircuit that is functional and nobody could see the circuit and only buttons are showed up.</h5>

            Here you can see my robot is moving backwward because I made a mistake and connected wrong wires coming from motors to the circiut! However, it could have worked properly if I connected wires from motors correcly to the clocky.
